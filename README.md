# gammaOS
Open-source 16 bit operating system, currently aiming to be slightly usable for daily use.

To build you simply need nasm (latest version recommended).

gammaOS is still in heavy development and it's nowhere near ready or it still can't even be considered alpha.

gammaOS goal is to be usable for daily use, that means I have to add/make:
-Network Stack
-Usable shell (or port an existing shell)
-Filesystem support (I still don't know what filesystem I want to support, but I might probably choose FAT32 or ext2. I may even make my own filesystem. We'll see)
-Port some userland apps (C compiler, an assembler, some UNIX games etc)
-Device drivers support
-Other goals. I'll add them one day.

I plan to code most of the OS in x86 Assembly, but I may do some of the code in C/C++, but idk, we'll see.
I am a begineer to Assembly (this is the first prototype that I fully wrote myself from experience I gained from coding previous prototypes and wiki.osdev.org) and Computer Engineering, but I learn pretty quick. I don't promise that the project will be ever done, because knowing me, I'll get bored soon or give up.

Any contribution is welcome :)
